                <p> At the top of each page you will see a welcome message and today's date.
                    If a previous user is displayed in the welcome message, click &quot;Log
                    Out&quot; to clear out any cookies they were using and <a href="#logging_in">log
                        in</a> as yourself.
                    Clicking the &quot;Help&quot; link brings a pop-up help window. Clicking
                    the &quot;Email Administrator&quot; link will open a new mail addressed to the system's
                    administrator.</p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="logging_in" id="logging_in"></a>Logging In</h5>
                <p>To log in, users must provide their login id and password. The login id
                    may be your fully-qualified email address ('user@example.com') or simply
                    your username ('user'). The administrator shall inform you of the correct
                    form to use. Selecting the &quot;Keep Me Logged In&quot; option will use
                    cookies to identify you each time you return to the quarantine, bypassing
                    the need to log in each time. <i>You should only use this option if
                        you are the only person using MailZu on your computer.</i> After
                    logging in, you will be redirected to the <a href="#message_summary">
                        Message Summary</a>.</p>

                    Please select the language that you prefer and all MailZu text
                    will be translated. This will not translate any text related to actual
                    email messages; it will only translate the application text. You will
                    need to log out to select a different language.</p>

                <h4><a name="using_mailzu" id="using_mailzu"></a>Using MailZu</h4>
                <p>MailZu allows the user to view quarantined messages based on the type of messages.
                    The most prevalent types of messages which will be quarantined are those that are
                    considered spam, or contain a banned attachment.
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="quick_links" id="quick_links"></a>My Quick Links</h5>
                <p>The Quick Links table will provide you with common application links.
                    The first, &quot;Quarantine Summary&quot; will give an overview of your message
                    quarantines.</p>
                <p> &quot;My Quarantine&quot; will take you to
                    an index of your unsolicited bulk email and banned attachments.</p>
                <p>&quot;Email Administrator&quot; is a quick way to contact your support
                    staff if you require assistance.</p>
                <p>&quot;Help&quot; gives you this document.</p>
                <p>The final link, &quot;Log Out&quot; will log you out of your current
                    session and return you to the log in screen.</p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="msg_summary" id="msg_summary"></a>Message Summary</h5>
                <p> The message summary is the default page after login. It gives you a quick count of
                    how many messages you have in your quarantine and their type.
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="msg_index" id="msg_index"></a>Message Indexes</h5>
                <p> Message indices show all the email for selected quarantined.
                    For each email quarantined, the index will show the From, Subject, and Date. Depending
                    on the quarantine currently in view, the index may show more information.</p>
                <p>To sort your index by a specific field, click on the field title. Clicking the field
                    title again will reverse the sort.</p>
                <p>Several buttons are available for handling the messages shown in the index. The
                    'Release/Request' action removes the message from the index and delivers the email as
                    if it had never been quarantined. The 'Delete' action only removes the message from the
                    index. These buttons perform the action on the messages selected through the checkboxes.
                    The 'Delete All' button ignores the state of the checkboxes and removes all messages in
                    the quarantine selected.</p>
                <p>When viewing your pending requests you can withdraw the request by clicking
                    'Cancel Request'. The message will no longer be queued for administrator review.
                </p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="search" id="search"></a>Message Search</h5>
                <p>Using the search function is a quick way to find a message you believe has been
                    quarantined. You can search for a message by specifying either who its from, or
                    what the subject is, or both. The search is not case sensitive.</p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="msg_view" id="msg_view"></a>Message View</h5>
                <p>The Message View allows you to see the contents of the message to help
                    determine if the message is legitimate. This view offers other options such
                    as to display the original plain text email and see additional message headers.
                </p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="da_site_list" id="da_site_list"></a>Site List</h5>
                <p>The "Site List" window allows an administrator to view and change individual Deny/Allow
		    list entries. Unlike a normal user the administrator can set individual list entries
		    for a user to individual values. In particular when an email recipient manages more than
		    one external email address, the administrator can set the Deny/Allow list entry for each
		    of these external email addresses to an individual value. The user cannot normally do this.</p>
		<p>The system supports three different matching types, namely:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Default - This means that email address matching in Amavis takes place on basis of either a full email address or
		    on just a (sub-) domain name.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exact Domain - This means that email address matching only takes place on basis of the domain name thereby excluding sub-domains.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Part - This means that an email address matching takes place on basis of the sender name excluding any domain.</p>
		<p>The system supports four different Deny/Allow values, namely:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny  - This means that an email from this address is denied without performing any further check.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow - This means that an email from this address is passed without performing any further check.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Neutral - This means that an email from this address is neither allowed nor denied but instead subjected to the
		    normal checks. The outcome of the check determines whether the email is passed or not.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft - This is similar to Neutral except that the soft list value specified in the next column is added to
		    the final score before a decision is made to pass on a message or not. Specifying "Soft" combined with a value of "0" is equivalent
		    to specifying "Neutral". The Numeric "Soft List" values must be in the range -999.0 ... 999.0 and can be incremented or
		    decremented `in steps of 0.1</p>
		<p>Further, this window allows the administrator to export entries, delete entries, invoke the
		    window to add entries and to perform updates of the DA list values. For export and delete there
		    are two options, namely exporting/deleting the selected entries by means of ticking the left
		    column, or exporting/deleting all entries. The latter option is search context sensitive. I.e.
		    if a subset of entries has been selected through the "List Search" option, then only those entries
		    will be exported/deleted. If no search criteria have been specified, the operation applies to the
		    entire database and to all users. Especially "Delete All" is dangerous. Without search criteria it
		    happily deletes the entire database for all users without asking for re-confirmation.</p>
		<p>Observe that in this window only the Deny/Allow list values can be updated. To change an email
		    address one has to delete the entry and add a new entry with the changed email address.
		</p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="da_my_list" id="da_my_list"></a>My List</h5>
		<p>The "My List" window allows a user who is not an administrator, to manage their own Deny/Allow
		   list entries. Observe that the user can only specify the email address to be allowed, checked or denied.
		   The setting is automatically applied to all external e-mail addresses the user manages. The possible settings
		   are as described under <a href="#da_site_list">Site List</a>.
		</p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="da_list_search" id="da_list_search"></a>List Search</h5>
		<p>In the search window an administrator or a user can specify search criteria to be applied to the "Site List" or "My List" windows.
		   An administrator can search on three different fields, whereby the different search criteria can only be "AND-ed" together. The
		   search criteria also apply to the "Export All" and "Delete All" functions. The three fields are:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Login Name - This refers to the login name of a user.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;User Email - This refers to email addresses the users manage.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Address - This refers to an external sender address.</p>
		<p>Non-administrative users can only search on the "Address".</p>
                <p class="alignright"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <h5><a name="da_add_list" id="da_add_list"></a>Add List Entries</h5>
		<p>In the "Add List Entries" window an administrator or user can add a sender's email address to the Deny/Allow list. An administrator
		   must chose to which user (login name) and external email address (User Email) the entry is added. A non-administrator user only needs to specify an external sender's address
		   which will then be added for each of the external e-mail addresses the user manages. DA list settings are as described under
		   <a href="#da_site_list">Site List</a>.</p>
		<p>By pressing the "next" button the administrator or user can add a further addresses. The already entered addresses will be checked to verify that they are
		   either email addresses, domain names or local parts, if supported. A suitable error messages shows the results.</p>
		<p>By selecting the "ignore" tickbox the address will not be added on submission and will not normally be shown after pressing "next". This
		   option is useful when importing large numbers of addresses from a CSV file or when a mistake in an earlier entry needs to be corrected. In the CSV file instead of deleting the line, one can set
		   the ignore value to 1. The ignore tickboxes are only shown when there are two or more entries.</p>
		<p>By selecting "Submit" the list is submitted to be added to the database. Submissions that fail, are shown. If all submission succeed,
		   the <a href="#da_site_list">Site List</a> or the <a href="#da_my_list">My List</a> window is shown.</p>
		<p>The administrator or the user can import addresses from a CSV file. First browse to find the file name, then press "Import". The import
		   function will add the imported entries to the "Add List Entries" window. Rows which have ignore set to 1 in the CSV file will be shown
		   with the ignore tick mark. The "Add List Entries" window does NOT page. Imports and manual entries can be mixed freely. Once done,
		   press "Submit". To obtain a sample CSV file, select one row in the <a href="#da_site_list">Site List</a> or the <a href="#da_my_list">My List</a>
		   window and then select "export". The administrator cannot import files generated by a user and vice-versa.</p>
