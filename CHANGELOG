MailZu-ng 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-00a08b4+1 (19.12.2022)
---------
  - Cleaned up the changes to the RFC822 code. Gone back to just making the minimum modifications
    to the original code and adding the extra functions for MailZu in a seperate library file. The
    RFC822 options can now also be defined in the config file. Two more variables have been added,
    namely $conf['da']['rfc822AllowComments'] and $conf['da']['public_internet'].

MailZu-ng 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-3ce1595+1 (19.12.2022)
---------
  - Fixed the query which finds the unreviewed email messages in quarantine. The obvious effect was
    that deleted messages to still be reported on subsequent days. This has now been fixed. The
    script now just shows messages which have not been reviewed or which are pending administrator
    approval prior to being released.
  - Fixed some message wording in the reporting script.

MailZu-ng 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-d7c6328+1 (14.12.2022)

  - Installed the DA list code.
  - Updated composer.json to include two new libraries.

MailZu-ng 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-64c2096+1 (13.12.2022)

  - Added a fallback From Email address ($conf['app']['fallbackEmailAddress']). Used by
    getFromEmailAddress.

    ($conf['script']['reportDays'], $conf['script']['sendZero'],$conf['script']['textEmail']).
  - Added a configuration for the mailzu clean-up script ($conf['script']['quarantineDays']).
  - Added an option to enable synchronisation of email addresses with the upstream authentication
    system which are not full addresses ($conf['auth']['acceptAllAddresses']).
  - Added the configuration variables for DA list processing ($conf['da']['enable'],
    $conf['da']['no_at_means_domain'], $conf['da']['adminCreatesUsers'],
    $conf['da']['defaultUserPolicy'], $conf['da']['defaultUserIsLocal'], $conf['da']['exportFile']).

MailZu-ng 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-9e76c14+1 (13.12.2022)
---------
  - The amavis database sql necessary to allow the users table tracking and future DA list update
    to function.
  - Added sample data files which should be edited to configure the local configuration and which
    provide policies and default DA list entries.
  - Added a sql contribution which enables two or more users to manage the same external email address.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-b966668+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Updated lang/{en_US.lang.php,en.help.php} to match earlier changes.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-25182fa+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - In mailzu-db-cleanup.php added a configuration option to set the number of days to keep
    ($conf['script']['quarantineDays']).
  - Added the script mailzu-db-reporting.sh. It creates per user a daily report of quarantined
    email messages and mails it to the user.
  - Added two example systemd timers to run the scripts.
  - Added docs/SCRIPTS_README.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-f34abbd+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - In langs.php changed the translate function to return a marked string if a translation does
    not exist instead of a question mark.
  - Removed the function to translate emails.
  - In en_US.lang.php removed references to phpScheduleIT. Removed unused translations to the best
    of my ability. Tabulated things for readbility. Added the necessary translation for the new DA
    list functionality.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-2f24e0b+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Merged administrators.
  - Added braces to a foreach loop of the cleanRow function to avoid issues if code gets added to
    that loop at a later date.
  - Added the functions necessary for the future DA list functionality. Rewrote convertSearch2SQl
    so that it can handle "begins_with", "not_begin_with", "ends_with" and "not_end_with" searches.
  - Also generalised the function to accept array values as criterion value as well as just a single
    value. This is required to deal with the idiosyncracies of the internal DA list representations.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-f47fb6d+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Merged administrators.
  - Renamed the function s_admin to isAdmin and updated the code to check the merged administrators.
  - Removed the function isMailAdmin. Fixed the COOKIE login process to recover missing data from
    the users table. It used to set all variables to the COOKIE_ID.
  - Added a cookie timeout configuration variable.
  - Fixed some translations and added some where there were none.
  - Added synchronisaton code for the users database. When a user logs in the users table entries
    are brought in line with the data that came from the authentication system.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-2d9503b+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Added 'lib/Priority.php' to the file list in composer.json.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-cdd1e6e+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Added a library which implements the priority calculations along a model that is in line with
    the expectations of the amavis system.
  - In addition, it implements a function which, using priority, returns an appropriate from email
    address in case a user tries to send an email to the administrator.
  - Updated minimum version of PHPMailer to 6.6 in composer.json.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-39f37ec+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Fixed mailzuMailer class definition so that composer/autoload can now find the
    PHPMailer class which it needs to extend (Did not seem to work at least on Debian 11).

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-c0d7a80+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Added an extra break to make the window created by printsendmail more legible.
  - Fixed the invocation of mailer class so that it does not throw external exceptions.
  - Replaced the mail->From, which used to be set by $_SESSION['sessionMail'][0], with a call to
    getFromMailAddr. When using the DA list extension the value of the SESSION variable used
    cannot be guaranteed to be a full email address. Hence the function.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-2767ae9+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Merged administrators.
  - Fixed an error message.
  - In the printSearchEngine function replaced the 'My Reservations' with 'Search' so that help
    functions properly.
  - Fixed issue with the display of the mail id in the quarantine screen and search.  Issue was
    that, with $conf['app']['allowMailid'] enabled, a normal user is allowed to search on mail
    id but the mail id was is not shown. Similarly, when the user is an administrator, the
    search window would always show a search on mail id, also when the administrator is
    navigating in his own personal USER quarantine and $conf['app']['allowMailid'] is disabled,
    which is the default.
  - When the mail id is shown, it always shows a partition tag of '[0]'. This is the Amavis
    default value and effectively means no partition (or in reality, one large partition). The
    sql query by default returns a zero partition tag because that is the default value in
    the database.
  - Updated README.md.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-02200be+1 (13.12.2022)
------------
  - Merged administrators.
  - Added translations for "Block images" and "Load images".

------------
  - Corrected error messages.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-6b7c25f+1 (12.12.2022)
------------
  - Merged administrators.
  - Fixed the send EMail to the administrator so that it now retrieves the From Address from
    the users table in the amavis database (getFromMAilAddr). For this update to work properly
    the users table needs to track the external authentication system(s).
  - Fixed invocation of the mailer class so that it does not throw external exceptions.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-8b9c7c5+1 (12.12.2022)
------------
  - Merged administrators.
  - Removed functions formatTime() and minutes_to_hours(). These functions appear like leftovers
    from the scheduling days.
  - Added search capabilities to quarantine search panel. It now also supports "begins with", "doesn't
    begin with", "ends with" and ""doesn't end with" search options.

MailZu-ng-da 0.12.mailzu-ng-da-php72-37e0277+1 (12.12.2022)

MailZu 0.7b:
----------

- Added compatibility for amavisd-new 2.4.0 or later database schema. Needed for
  proper handling of file-based quarantining.

  If you are currently using amavisd-new 2.4.0 or later, no changes are necessary.

  If you are using a version of amavisd-new prior to 2.4.0 (with old database 
  schema), please add the 'quar_loc' column to your 'msgs' table with:

    ALTER TABLE msgs ADD quar_loc varchar(255) DEFAULT '';
  
  This is a mandatory requirement for this version and future versions of MailZu.
  In other words, MailZu does not care which version of amavisd-new you are running,
  as long as the SQL tables match those that are needed by amavisd-new 2.4.0 or  
  later.

- Specific SQL queries when listing a quarantine index tended to be optimized when
  using MySQL only. These queries are now used only when the site configures MySQL 
  as their backend. Faster and efficient queries are now the default when any other
  database is chosen. 

- Admins should have been able to login even though the configuration parameter 
  login_restriction was set to 'true'. This was not the case and was fixed to work
  as intended.

- In a quarantine index, deleting all the items on the last page would then return
  a page with no results. Fixed. Reported by Paolo Cravero.

- In a quarantine index, using the "Delete All" button would delete the items on
  the first page only. This has been fixed to include all items in a quarantine index.


MailZu 0.6:
----------

- Fix bug when displaying error message after a failed release
- Add a FAQ item on releasing emails and where to get support
